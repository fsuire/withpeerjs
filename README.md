Withpeerjs is a small angular/webRTC/nodejs app, made in order to try the [PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs) library. 

##Setup

```
git clone ...
gulp --dev
```

A new browser tab opens, just close it. Then, open two different browser (or use a browser private session) and go, for both of them, to http://localhost:3001, and, finally, enter a different nickname for the both of them.

You can now use the "create a public room" functionnality, add a user to this new room (look at the upper right corner of the window), and begin a RTC conversation beetween your two browsers.
